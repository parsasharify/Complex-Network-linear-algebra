In fact, checking all possible states requires $O(N!)$ while $N$ is a number of nodes. Obviously, it is not efficient enough. Thus, we try to reach an approximate solution. The method used here is Accept-Reject. In each stage, We rewire the current network in order to obtain better synchronization(which is measured by $r$). If the rewiring result is better than the current network, it is accepted, else, it is rejected (in [refrence 1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260439709_Optimal_Synchronization_of_Complex_Networks/citations) you can find a theoretical critera to accept or reject rewired graph  with linear formulation of the Kuramoto model based on  the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix).\n",
