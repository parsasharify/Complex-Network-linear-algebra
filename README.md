# Complex-Network-linear-algebra
In this project, the following steps are performed:  
1)Introducing the concepts of complex networks and synchronization. 
2)Familiarity with Runge-Kutta tool and graph data structure. 
3)Measuring the degree of synchronization of graph using kuramoto order parameter. 
4)Rewiring algorithm implementation to improve synchronization.
