# Complex-Network-linear-algebra
In this project, the following steps are performed:  Introducing the concepts of complex networks and synchronization. Familiarity with Runge-Kutta tool and graph data structure. Measuring the degree of synchronization of graph using kuramoto order parameter. Rewiring algorithm implementation to improve synchronization.
